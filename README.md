## Notes 

- `innerHTML` was used in the code to simplify markup generation. The unsafe nature of `innerHTML` does not pose a real threat in this application for learning purposes. In the unlikely case the API was hacked, we'll add defenses on client-side so that we don't render external malicious content.
